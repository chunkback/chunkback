**ChunkBack lets you test your apps with LLM provider endpoints without having to pay for the providers.**



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc4813e-fe7d-4b97-8d03-2f109e320c1c



ChunkBack is a simple express server that emulates the response input and output of popular LLM providers, currently Gemini, Anthropic and OpenAI. Chunkback accepts a custom prompt language called [CBPL](./CBPL.md) that lets you customize the response to your applications.

## Quick Start

```
npx chunkback@latest
```

Then run in your terminal:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5654/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "swag",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "SAY \"First message\"\nCHUNKSIZE 3\nCHUNKLATENCY 50\nSAY \"Second message\""}
    ]
  }'
```

## Why use ChunkBack?

- **Deterministic API response** - You always will get back the same content you put in
- **Saves money** - When testing your application, you can stub out your LLM calls with this
- **Open Source** - You can see the code right there!
- **No extra services dependencies** - There's no DB no Redis no nothing, just server code

## Hosted Version

I am hosting a version of Chunkback on `api.chunkback.com` (sign up on the main site [chunkback.com](https://chunkback.com)) so you can plug it in without having to set anything up. I'm asking for 20$ a month for unlimited usage, or you can use it for free for 1000reqs/month.
